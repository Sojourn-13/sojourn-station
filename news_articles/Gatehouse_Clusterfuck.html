Details
<br>
At 12:10 an independent pilot aboard the shuttle "Broken Shield" attempted to contact the colony for the purpose of refueling. The pilot, identified as Laurel, was denied permission to land within the colony LZ and was instead instructed to land within the forest before making contact with the colony on foot. After arriving, Laurel revealed quite openly that he was an excelsior agent, tasked with disrupting the colony, and even produced the requisite equipment he was provided to cause severe damage to Nadezhda. Questioning revealed that, though he was implanted, his laws were not worded strictly enough to prevent him from subverting his directives. Given his group, known as the "Freelanders" had been attacked by the excelsior, he wished to aid the colony against them. However, due to laws he could not circumvent he was still unable to directly tell interrogators what he knew, requiring them to ask questions and piece together the details through basic interrogation practices. Sadly for the colony, only Jeanne Petite proved even vaguely capable in this regard, obtaining a slew of information about Laurel's personal background. Yet, before more critical information could be discovered, warrant officer Mariya Lichzand-Sankinova expressed volatility at the situation, vehemently expressed that they did not care about the information Laurel was offering, and essentially drove what would have been an extremely valuable asset to the colony to instead simply leave. As Laurel attempted to leave via using a breaching hatton, Sankinova opened fire on him, setting off the explosives he carried and had warned everyone about multiple times prior, inadvertently injuring three people, killing two, and destroying the gate house. <br>
<br>
The where abouts of Laurel, who walked off the explosion rather easily given his scaf suit, nanogate, and synthetic nature, is currently unknown. It is presumed he returned to his ship and moved it away from the colony, but is presently unable to leave the planet due to a lack of fuel, something he revealed early on. Whether the attack on his person allows him to remain a potential asset is currently unknown.<br>
