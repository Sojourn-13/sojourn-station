This article comes from the Nadezhda News Network. It summarizes a direct emergency announcement from the Council itself.

A deal at last has been struck with the nearby faction known as the “Cult of Daskvey”. The exact details for this deal have yet to be fully published by the Council. However, what we do know is the Fragment of Amethyn, the Lonestar ``insurance policy” has been temporarily relocated off colony. While the Council understands the risks of this move, it assures the colony at large, that the surface team, are the ones most informed, and in contact with these situations, and their judgment as a council is the safest option for handling delicate matters like these.
<br><br>
As such, the Nadezhda economy has been partially “frozen” as the Council has announced. Many departments have stopped receiving much more than bare minimum funding from the council, leading to shortages in wage money. The prices for necessities have, for the time being, been frozen in place. And departments themselves, have started to withhold their own funding from the economy at this time, due to the loss of the “hard backing” of the colony approved credit, the standard currency of exchange has lost its local worth.
<br><br>
The Council suggests the Fragment will be returned in the coming week, after the deal with the outside faction concludes. At which point all economic restrictions will be lifted returning the economy to a free flowing state again. The reasons for the freeze are vague and full of many legal terms, mostly revolving around protecting the colony from forming a large debt, while we have no way to solidly back it up if the credit goes bust.
