This article appears to be from some small news outlet on the colony, "Underground Uplink" most news is from the council itself, and due to the council being a collaboration of all factions of the colony, its official news outsets are prevented from bias. However, in this case, the council has given no news on this event, thus, "Underground Uplinks" article slowly gained more and more traction before exploding into being seen on most NT-Net sites on the colony network.

Good afternoon Undergrounders! The uplink is here as your open funding news source and today we have a special report on something that has only been murmured and rumored about, that for once our council haven't given a official news report on, only statements that sit on council update pages. We grabbed them, and sorted them here to make it easy for YOU to get the download on what's new.

Two days ago on the 5th, the surface team had what official documents call a "Wildlife event". However reading it over more thoroughly, shows this to only be part of the truth. Starting at the beginning of the report "A strange noise emanated from directly below the colony.". Colonists report this as a "metallic screech". However no one seems to be 100% on what the noise was. This noise was followed by stampedes of jungle wildlife driven into rampage, attacking the gate, causing severe damage and injury.

The official council report ends there, HOWEVER, prospector mission log for the day reads differently, and the church of the absolute signed off on its validity, something we hardly ever see happen for just a mission report. Prospectors launched a two prong operation to the swamp using their shuttle and ground team. With the assistance of members of the church. On arrival they found "Anomalies" a new form of oddity, clouds of hazy smoke, that lit things around them on fire, large webs of green lights, that prevented further movement, apparently heavy casualties were sustained to these "anomalies". Further more prospectors reported new roaches, and a creature described as being from "deep maint", Soteria announced that isn't possible, the "deep maint" creatures cant leave that realm for very long, let alone get to the swamp. Prospectors claim they have physical proof of this, but at this time hogg hasn't displayed it in any way.

The high council has been meeting nearly daily sense this event in full force, which we hardly see, usually only a few heads move to the council office every day. But in the past few days every head has been seen coming and going from the high council offices. To us at the uplink, this seems like debates on this event, or perhaps resolution ideas for it. We just simply don't know until they finish debating on it and let the council official news outlets give us the inside story. Whatever this is, its one of the few times our council has delayed releasing an official report, we leave it to you to decide what you think their reasons are, as we can only guess.

That's all on this topic for now folks, we will keep you Undergrounders linked in as best we can if any more word comes out on these events.
