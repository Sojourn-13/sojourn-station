"Iron Tyrant" has been destroyed by Aaron Unk, a former member of the prospectors. This blow to the colonies defenses was done by the former prospector under the belief of bias in the Nadezhda marshals, seeking to cripple them for perceived injustices on his behalf. True or not, Unk has been executed by firing squad after being charged with an extensive list of crimes before being condemned by tribunal. His death a landmark in the colonies first execution of a head of staff, Unk being a former foreman before his untimely death. A short funeral via cremation was held for his passing, but reportedly nobody except a single vector, the acting premier, and the acting biolab overseer attended.

This case comes along with the news that, the day prior to its destruction, the Iron Tyrant had been stolen by an outsider who successfully infiltrated the colony. Despite their best efforts to escape with the tyrant, however, the outsider was disabled and captured using ion weaponry by the combined efforts of the marshals and blackshield. This occurrence happened during a key critical meeting between the low council and is not the first time this has happened by a wily outsider.

As a result of the repeated actions and attacks by multiple outsiders, the provost marshal has declared open season on non-allies and non-citizens of the colony when in the field. A change that has already reportedly been unpopular with everyone who has never had to deal with outsiders. But many reports of prospectors and security team members are not only happy with the change, but eager to finally put these annoyances in the ground once and for all. Time will tell if this decree will remain. Is it a reactionary action taken in anger or simply how life on the frontier must be? Time will tell.
