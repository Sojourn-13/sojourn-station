===The month in recap! (powered by Nadezhda Newscenter®™)===

This article comes from the Nadezhda News Network. It is a lengthy article merely summarizing and pointing to many much more boring long logs of council meetings as its sources. The article itself is a quick dive into recent events now that all the information from the council has been made public for all.

The recent month has been a wild one for the surface team, between anomalous planet activity and contact with cultists in the jungle, the council has only recently given a massive publication of decisions made both down in lower, and negotiations handled by upper.
<br><br>
First of note, during explorations of anomalous hotspots a so-called “Blackstone Tablet” was discovered and reclaimed through effort, an apparent data storage device of unknown size or contents, that was sent to the church of the absolute numerical division for research. The numericals publications speak of great swathes of knowledge; they can only decipher piecemeal size, describing the process as “Fourier Analysis of the mind and its thoughts”. Soteria has offered many bids for access to the tablet, however after initial analysis of its contents, Augustine Browne herself classified the tablet as a sacred relic to be studied and understood carefully by the church itself, with all knowledge being publicly released.
<br><br>
Later that month, contact was made with a new faction in the jungle. A cult by the looks of it, calling themselves “The hand of Daskvey”. Apparent psionic entities that live outside of the depths of deep maintenance. Self proclaimed free members from the grasp of the maintenance, in past rough meetings they have made claims to seek only the destruction of deep maint, and the freedom of their own people, apparently former inhabitants also of the depths. Their leader, exact true intentions, and technology level are still undetermined at this time. However preliminary reports indicate they can be aligned with. If this is a good idea or not remains to be seen as the surface team works out the fine details during these tense negotiations.
<br><br>
And speaking of tense negotiations, a sudden arrival from an unexpected faction, the Mar’Qua have made themselves known in the system. An apparent research station nearby, interested in our homeworld, but not so much us by the looks of the meeting reports, and their lack of interacting with us in the past. They come now in the name of research of course, interested to see the recent anomalies themselves, and resolve them possibly, something Soteria has seemingly been uninterested in handling, or perhaps unable to handle. In either case, the Mar’Qua tread carefully around us, our colony has been one of boundaries pushed, some they do not enjoy to see being pushed, such as our use of Artificial intelligence, a direct crime near sacrilege to their people.
<br><br>
As for the future, a tense and perhaps defining negotiation comes soon, a Mar’Quaian research party will be landing tomorrow to set out into the jungle with the colony’s help. To conduct their studies of the main temple for the Cult of Daskvey, whether access comes through negotiation or force is yet to be seen or announced. The tensions on the surface are high as usual, the question remains to be seen how they will be released, through force or dialogue, and what consequences we may see due to those choices.
