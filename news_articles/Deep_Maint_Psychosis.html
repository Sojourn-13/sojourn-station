A prospector from a deep maints expedition team was reported to have gone crazy, nearly killing one of the expedition members over a trivial action before journeying to deep maintenance. From there, colonists were informed of the now missing prospector, whom was reported to have been using telepathic communication to reach out to others, their words nothing more than the ramblings of a madman.

A team was sent in due team, consisting of the Church and the Prospectors, where both the dreaming king and its hounds were encountered at the same time. However, a rather reckless Guild Master took it upon themselves to charge into the chaotic depths of the tunnels and seek out the missing prospector. Upon contact between said Guild Master and the prospector, a firefight shortly happened as from reports, the Guild Master was quick to threaten a madman with her rail gun, and was reported to not have once used the non lethal settings on it. Afterwards, a dead Prospector was dragged back and revived for both a interview and a psych evaluation.

Rather concerning and questionable about the Guild's own members so quick to take such brutal and reckless action, it is believed that what happened to the prospector was due to a small experiment they willingly took part in. This resulted in them seemingly going mad, as the item in question was of psionic properties from deep maints. Further examination after his recovery shows that he seems to be mentally healthy, if not shaken by the events of what occurred.

Similar reports of this nature have been reported lately, although the actions taken vary as well as the psychotic natures of the individuals. Currently, there are theories that psions are being affected in some manner by deep maints. However, this has proven to be difficult to prove as non psions have also had such situations of psychosis happening. One thing is for certain however. There is something dark and sinister about those twisted tunnels.<br>
