Tragedy strikes with the news from local contract salvage ship ISB Hardspace. Yesterday, 5/4/2651, Hardspace and her crew arrived at Amethyn on a contract to salvage some artifacts for study by kriosan research companies. Lack of proper co-ordinates lead to Hardspace being closer to our allies on Amethyn then first thought, landing near the colony of Nadezhda. Information on the specifics is slow, but most reports claim miscommunication, and haste action lead to a battle starting between Hardspaces' ground crew and the colony.

The battle reportedly was only but a few minutes long. But in that time more then half of the surface team of Hardspaces' exploration crew were dead on the ground. The colony itself also took looses from Hardspaces quick response involving even orbital bombardment via their "scrap cannon". Soon a cease fire was called, and the survivors of each side returned home, before negotiations began to review the incident. Captain of the ISB Hardspace, Halbert Coleman, has said he will wait to give statement on specifics until his return to Krios. Though he has stated all operations on or near Amethyn are now indefinitely postponed, and is offering refunds to the companies that commissioned his ship, though requesting they leave some money for the lost crews families.

Word from Nadezhda High council says they will be looking into the incident and working with their surface council to figure out what went wrong and how to prevent something like this from happening again. While no official news of reparations' have come out from either side yet, unknown rumors say families have been paid out one hundred thousand credits each, these numbers have not been backed up yet by fact, but the rumors also appear to state less then ten percent of this payout comes from the colony itself, with Hardspace footing most of the bills for the families in loss.
<br>
Captain Coleman of the Hardspace left our holocall with one last closing remark reciting the saying "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster." claiming fears of desensitization in the sector leading to our local sector getting only more and more violent, as less and less compassionate for fellow men and women which may leave the sector in a worse state then it started.
<br>
We too believe this topic should be looked into more, follow our newsletter for updates on this incident, and meetings with ethics committees for their opinions on the effects of desensitization on the sector
