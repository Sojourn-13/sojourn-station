Key Information
<br>
* An infiltrator of unknown origin attacked the gate house, using an anti-materiel rifle, the mercenary managed to killed several people. In a prolonged and drawn out shoot out, the sniper picked off multiple members of the marshals, blackshield, and soteria.
<br>
* Later, after being captured, the infiltrator revealed that he discovered the entrance to the rumored excelsior bunker and claimed that it was actually located on planet. He further claimed that the reason the excelsior has contributed so much resources and man power in attempting to seize the colony was because the location of this bunker and the colonies proximity to its potential resource storage jeopardized their stronghold.
<br>
* The mercenary is now on the payroll of the colony, the payment worked out by agreement between the Marshals and Soteria, though the details of the matter are sealed by order of the Provost Marshal.
<br>
* The mercenary is attempting to discover either the location of a working excelsior teleporter or information on a way that the colony can discover this base of operations. However, the mercenary admitted it was unlikely he would find much as he warned the excelsior already knew of his methods.

Details
<br>
On March 4th, after reviewing of a potential attack given intel gathered the day prior, the low council decided to fortify colony defenses in preparation for a potential assault. This proved a serendipitous choice, as a sniper and mercenary under the code name "Deadman" began firing upon the colony gate house from his position in the forest. Deadman proved an exceptional marksman, killing several members of both the security teams and soteria. As Deadman began shooting out the cameras, soteria overseer Jeanne Petite employed a combat mech class durand in an effort to over come the sniper fire. Deadman responded by shooting out the mech's guidance system, forcing overseer Jeanne to attempt field repairs. However, as this was being done, Deadman re-positioned his sniper's nest and took our the overseer before repairs could be completed. Given the mounting casualties and the snipers seemingly extensive ammo, multiple agents were dispersed in flanking positions in an attempt to get the drop of Deadman. Blackshield corpsman Quill E. Bright, warrant officer Arin Moon, and church prime Ray attempted to encircle, with corpsman Quill landing multiple shots on Deadman using a reductor rail rifle provided by guild adept Mariya Lichzand-Sankinova. As Deadman was forced to retreat from his position, prime Ray advanced, using his joyeuse and rosaria shield. As Ray attempted to force Deadman down using the Ire litany, the mercenary resisted it and killed prime Ray using his rifle. At that moment warrant officer Arin Moon closed in, forcing the now severely wounded Deadman into a fighting retreat before he ran into corpsman Bright. Deadman managed to blow off the corpsmans arm, but before he succumbed to his injuries, Bright put Deadman down with multiple shots from his reductor rifle. At this point WO Moon and Wilson arrived, securing the mercenary and bodies before treating their many injuries.

After being treated and scanned, Deadman was brought to interrogation where he was reported as being indifferent both to the colony and his employers, revealing information when prompted but never quite volunteering anything. As a result trust was slow building until investigators, relying on both his indifference and the fact he was a mercenary for hire, struck a deal with Deadman, later revealed to be named Clarence. While the details of the payment are sealed, the deal was created in such a way that Deadman cannot collect his payment until he brings information for the colony. As a result, he was released to gather intel on his former employers, though the low council are unsure if he can truly be trusted, his rifle and armor were kept as collateral. What he may report, if anything, remains to be seen.<br>
