===An odd twist of fate (powered by Nadezhda Newscenter®™)===
<br>
On the morning of the 28th of January the colony received an envoy from the Mar’qua stating the final part of their recent dealings, the immediate destruction of the Cult of Daskvey’s artifact known as the “Heart”. The colony requested a short time to speak to the Cult and attempt to recover the Fragment of Amethyn.
<br><br>
On arriving at the scene the colony was met with unidentified hostile mercenaries, followed soon after by assaults by Voidwolfs and reavers. After a half hour of combat against these groups the cult sent out its own forces to scour the jungle clean of stragglers.
<br><br>
Shortly after a deal was completed granting the colony the return of its Fragment, which will hopefully in the coming day mean the end of the economic pause. What happened after is largely unknown, conflicting reports and claims of insanity at the exact place of the incident. What is known is that suddenly the colony engaged in hostilities with the cult. Clearing its upper floor of cultists before being ordered to stop.
<br><br>
In the aftermath, there appears to be no winners. The Mar’Qua have gone radio silent once more, The Cult who had just completed their first successful deal with the colony before the massacre, sent an envoy declaring a cessation of diplomatic talks with them at this time. While the issue of the anomalies remains entirely unsolved.
<br><br>
The only gain of late has been the Blackstone tablet of the numericals at the church, who state that at least in the aftermath of all this, they will be releasing their best designs at mitigating the damage of the anomalies while more permanent measures are researched.
