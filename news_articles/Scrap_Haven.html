News has finally come down to the lower colony via the prospectors after thorough checking of a new potential ruin for scavs and other thrill seekers to hit, loot, and die in. Nicknamed the Scrap Haven by the resident void wolves who have already taken up shop, this cavern systems seems to be the crater of a fallen star ship. Some have already speculated that it was a fragment of the blown apart space fortress, a popular idea but not entirely believed as veteran prospectors have already noted much of the ruin does not match the remembered asteroid base interior.

Unfortunately, the area is currently controlled by an unknown group of void wolf reavers who have deployed teams of vat grown workers to strip the place of materials and salvage. The sheer size of the ship however means such an operation is a constant affair and the unknown enemy has set up a permanate rock base inside the walls of the cavern. Some have also reported that outsiders have been seen scaling up and down the rock walls, making the territory hotly contested.

While worrisome to some, for the scrap haven is dangerously close to the colony, blackshield intelligence officers have already concluded it presents little threat. The area is ill suited as a staging point to assault the colony due to a natural choke point at the caverns entrance. As such, it is the problem of the prospectors, who already are making sojourns to the cave to gun down vat growns in search of plunder. The entrance to the scap haven appears to be a small almost hidden passage near the burned outpost, south west of the gate house.

Local lodge hunters have also noted that a secondary entrance is also present, north of the river forest, providing a shorter but far more dangerous path now between the colony and lodge by foot.<br>
