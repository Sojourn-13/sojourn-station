Excelsior agent 'Jamie', a cindarite and former void wolf was secreted amongst the colony to fulfill the primary objective of sabotaging the power grid. While Jamie succeeded, they were apprehended during completion of secondary objectives, being found by first warrant officer Zhuul and then shortly after an unrecorded personal when they attempted to flee. Jamie was taken alive after receiving several wounds before being given medical treatment and having their excelsior implant removed. Once the implant was removed, Jamie proved cooperative, revealing that they were a former void wolf captured by the excelsior and repurposed as an infiltrator. Her former crew, the 'Frakken Freebooters' are presumed KIA, as Jamie revealed she was taken to an excelsior stronghold before being implanted, given mission critical equipment (a silenced pistol, access badge, and uplink), and then brought closer to the colony through the use of a long range teleporter. Jamie spoke of how she entered the colony through the use of a falsified badge and voice modulator, slipping in with the prospectors through the use of a disguise before attempting to accomplish their objective. Unusually, Jamie was also given a set of incomplete records, likely from excelsior hackers, but the information was incomplete, revealing her presence when sabotaged was suspected and records were checked. Jamie was unable to determine much about the circumstances of her capture, only that given her background as a technician and armorer for her ship she noted that the excelsior were heavily outfitted and well fortified, with an unusual amount of augmentations carried by what is believed to be a member of the inner party who referred to herself as Gloria.

Interrogators, Commander Va'Ra-da and WO Zhuul, were unable to glean more information, but given Jamie's cooperative stance and reasonable story, she was placed into cryo temporarily for Marshal review with the promise of being later released in a neutral ground referred to as the Hell Zone, a void wolf space station.
