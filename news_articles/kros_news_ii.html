===Trouble in Sector N-2 (powered by Nadezhda Newscenter®™)===

<br>
Good day all our readers both local and far, this is your source for the Kriosian News that matters. Our headline story is  from the events of yesterday in Sector N-2, home of the Lothen Bastion and the Lothen family. A large explosion went off in the heart of the bastion, damaging several essential components inside the Orbital Cannon’s base. At current there are only a few injuries reported with no loss of life. Some speculation by experts has cited this might have been deliberate sabotage by a yet-unknown element seeking to attack the Orbital Cannon’s Breech and Firing Control Mechanisms.

His Lordship Henrik Lothen, head of the Lothen Family and Bastion, has declined to make comment outside of stating that an investigation is underway. As such, a number of other bastions across the planet have been placed on alert with increased security restrictions and additional mechanical staff on standby. Those who routinely travel into or out of bastions for work, please take this into account as your commute will be slightly longer. We have been promised further details as the investigation comes to an end.<br>
