The Cold-Hive Daily
<br>
===Mango's Untitled Stream #473===
<br><I>
The Cold-Hive Daily. An independent news station that no one can really discern where it originated from, but presently is left streaming on screens in under-decorated waiting rooms and bars owned by people who have an innate distaste for more established, or more obviously sponsored stations reporting current events within the Colony. The presence or absence of bias in The Cold-Hive Daily is a topic of little interest, even among the (speculated) dozens of regular watchers. TC-HD is commonly dismissed as an obscure form of satire by the public, a stance which has yet to be rebutted by the news team in any official capacity.
<br>
<br>
On the mentioned screens, shortly after an ad for a new flavor of Colonist Cola finishes playing, a stuttering animation of an amateurly made logo flashes. The screen cuts to black. Before immediately cutting to video.
<br>
<br>
A Cindarite, with a dull maroon color to their scales sits at a plastic desk.  The most prominent feature on them being a pair of straight, cone-shaped horns on the back of their head, pointing towards each other. The horns themselves are a greyish color comparable to the unkempt steel wall behind the individual, they even look like they have a layer of sooty-dust on them. Beady, sunken black eyes stare at the camera, with no visible portion of the sclera visible, save for when they glance off to either side of the set, exposing the elsewise elusive whites of their eyes. A nearly jarringly bright light is stationed above, drawing attention to the fact they appear to have a sweaty gleam to their scales. All these details only worked for so long as a distraction, before one of the more questionable fashion decisions are apparent when they raise their eye-ridges, said ridges are pitch black and glisten even more than the scales. Apparently they're colored in by some sort of marker, to give the appearance of eyebrows. 
<br>
<br>
When they speak, after the period of silence with the creature lifting and lowering their eye-ridges with unbroken eye-contact to the camera, it sounds like their throat is filled with gravel, a distinct rattle audible on any given inhale or exhale. They spoke with a deliberate tone and haste to their words, but are frequently interrupted by their own, raspy inhales. Though, thankfully, this Cindarite does not have a heavy lisp to their speech for most words.
<br>
<br></i>
"Greetings, dear Colonists... This is your... Cold-Hive... Daily. Host Claire Mango..."
<br>
<br><i>
Likely apparent to any Cindarite watching due to their rounded, if stubby snout, this individual was a female.
The Cindarite doesn't speak for a few breaths, but they soon continue.
<br>
<br></i>
"We hope you. Enjoyed the report on... Upcoming... Asssstronomical events... Do remember to go... To the surface after... Asssstronomical twilight for the upcoming night-sky phenomenon..."
<br>
<br><i>
Mango clears their throat, the sheer amount of noise in such would make one wonder how their throat isn't obstructed entirely.
<br>
<br>
A figure walks in from the side, placing a small stack of papers on the table, before they turn to face the camera, too tall to have their face revealed, but it appears to be a tall, lankily thin, earthy-brown Naramad in casual attire that realizes they're in the view of the camera, promptly shuffling out of the shot. 
<br>
<br>
Without acknowledging the presence or motion of the other figure, Mango slowly lowers their head to look at the paper, bringing their hands forward to pick up the bundle, and stare at it. After a few more breaths, they begin reading directly off the paper.
<br>
<br></i>
"...We... See... Four." 
<br><i>
<br>
They're cut off by some murmuring from behind the camera, Mango's head slowly turning to face the noise, and equally as slowly looking back at the paper, their gaze visibly trailing to a different part of the page. Meanwhile, a door is heard is opening, and footsteps are heard darting out of earshot.
<br>
<br></i>
"Oh... Okay."
<i>A sheen shimmers over her eyes, a clear, second membrane of eyelids blinking for the first time since the broadcast started. She begins speaking once more.</i>
"...On other, newly apparent news... Our reporters have heard... An increase of commotion from both... Management of the Artificers Guild... And those within contact of... The Ssssoteria Inssstitute."
<i>Mango skims the paper over, visibly apparent by her eyes darting down the rest of the paper, before she returns to staring at the camera while setting the papers down.</i>
"It appears... We may have a... Ambitious project in the works... Requests for... Former station architects... Have been seen... Within the colony... Net."
<br>
<br>
"Mango!" 
<i>The previously murmuring voice called out, proving to be a higher pitched, nasally, but masculine tone. They elaborated.</i>
"We've got some a'.. Some.. Live feed! We'll be switching over." 
<br>
<br>
<i>Mango gives a slow nod, responding with a tone as courteous as her rough voice could seemingly present.</i>
"Very.. Well." With the following silence as someone off camera audibly fumbled with some physical equipment. For the last few seconds, Mango lifted and lowered their eye-ridges a few times, tilting their head around to observe how the marker-eyebrows looked in different angles.
<br>
<br>
<i>The stream goes black, showing a bold [NO INPUT DETECTED] before some static took over the screen, before a supposedly live feed cuts in, obviously being streamed on some consumer handheld device in terms of quality. The camera faces downwards as the cameraman jogs, dull colored floor tiling flying by at a impressive pace until they catch up to where they scurrying to. Though the elongated shoes dotting in and out of sight would lend credence to the fact the person holding the camera was likely a Naramad. After stumbling to a halt, the flailing of the camera's view signifying balance nearly being lost after the abrupt stop, soon focused in on an Abhuman, visibly representative of some sort of wild-cat, potentially a Lynx, if someone had to guess. They were short, stocky, and wearing an oversized armor-vest with PRESS unevenly formed on the chest and back of it, with strips of white tape making up the letters.
<br>
<br>
Despite the hasty approach, no panting was heard from the camera-man while the following exchange commenced, though the camera shifted, being held too high for the initial portion of the conversation.
<br>
<br>
The person being interviewed was standing near a wall, a giant orange and black Kriosan clad in jackboots, camo pants, a loose hazard vest and a tan cap. 
<br>
<br>
As the camera focuses in on the taller Kriosan, a large, obtrusive panel cuts in on the screen with no animation, displaying the following words.</i>
<br><b>[Sieghardt Meldurson]
<br>	[Guild Master]</b>
<br>
<br>
<i>It promptly is dragged off, with the panel highlighting as a computer desktop interface briefly flashes into view, before re-focusing on the live-feed. The Abhuman was holding out a wireless microphone out towards the Kriosan,starting their conversation for the camera, "Greetings, Mr. Meldurson, I'm with the C.H.D. And we were wondering if you were willing to discuss some buzz going around the Guild at this time, do you able to discuss the details at this time?"
<br>
<br>
Having forgotten to shift the microphone to themselves while they spoke, the Abhuman just sways the microphone a little closer to the Kriosan, though it could be passed off as a modestly intrusive gesture. The camera is shakily shifted towards the Kriosan, being moved up and down a few times until a suitable angle is found.
<br>
<br>
The lit cigarette that sat in the Kriosan's mouth is moved from one side to the other before finally disappearing, presumably having been eatten as he responds with</i> "Aye. Dere's always sum'fin ayn' da' works 'round da' Guild, but da' big project's 'round sum' new contracta' biz'niz." <i>This was all finished off with an audible rasp produced by the Kriosan's hand as it scratched his dusty chest.</i>
<br>
<br>
"Et's all at' Ryan-" <i>The Kriosan trails off, loud sparks heard as what could be assumed to be industrial welding blinds the camera feed for a moment or two from the side.</i>
<br>
<br>
"Az' ay' wuz' sayin', dat' gardn'a in da' red suit's idea, he came ta' me wiff sum idea's, sum' sponsorships an' a whole lotta' money, so da' Guild's workin' up ta' fix up sum tradin' beacons an' spaceworthy stuff fer'em." <i>The Kriosan continues, abruptly interrupting the impromptu interview to go do some bare-eye welding alongside the other adepts. The recording lingers on the safety-squint welding for a few seconds, before the rather dumbfounded Abhuman turns to face the camera.</i>
<br>
<br>
"Well... I picked out the words 'beacons' and 'spaceworthy' from that, we'll have to review that footage later, Kevin. I don't think we're live, go ahead and run the footage to them."
<br>
<br>
<i>A dull</i> "Uhhuh." <i>Was heard from the camera-person, whom promptly immediately darted off with the camera, what was a jog prior, was now a full, Naramad-class sprint down the hall, the walls and floor tiles now mere blurs in the camera's view.
<br>
<br>
Some static flashes cuts the shaky footage off, and returns to Mango, who was near-eerily in the same exact posture they were in before the cutaway. Albeit, she had the notable difference of her head being craned a few inches forward, her squinted eyes seem to be staring at something beyond the camera.
<br>
<br>
Her eyes snap to the camera on someone's audio cue, the sclera of her eyes visible until her head turns to match the gaze. Her mouth opens and shuts with an audible clack, before she speaks, once again with the frequent pauses for her raspy inhales.</i>
<br>
<br>
"Mango... Is not entirely... Sure what the Guild-Master said... Exactly. Does anyone-"
<br>
<br>
<i>Mango is cut off by footsteps rapidly thumping into earshot, causing her head to snap towards a direction to the right. The nasally voice from before frantically calls out </i>
<br>
<br>
"Kevin hold on!-", <i>But to apparently no avail, as the earthy-brown Naramad seen before crashes catastrophically into frame. The Naramad collided with the table, quickly sending one half upwards (Also revealing the table was in fact a plastic folding table), and snapping the other half off the hinge.
<br>
<br>
Mango herself is thrown back by the table toppling over entirely, the half that was sent upwards initially, arcs towards the camera, sending it crashing to the ground. Though, the broadcast continued up until the camera hit the ground, briefly showing a ceiling missing more than a few panels.
<br>
<br>
A bold [NO INPUT DETECTED] shows for a few seconds, before a choppy looping animation of a 3D model of Mango's head rotating in circles in front of a banner that states [MINOR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, PLEASE STAND BY] fades into view.</i>
