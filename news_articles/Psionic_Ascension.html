A lonestar news logo appears on the holoscreen before fading into communications officer Nowak, sitting at a desk with a few sheaths of paper, here to report news within the colony.

"For those, somehow, unaware with the recent actions of the Soteria, a new avenue of research has begun for the erstwhile institute. For supposedly years, the institutes director has been working towards expansion on the mind towards the ability to make science fiction now scientific fact. This has come in the form of psionic ascension, according to soteria researchers."<br>
<br>
<i>Nowak favors the camera with a dry smile, </i>"Because giving the likes of prospectors and other thuggish psychotics mind powers is the kind of intelligent planning the Soteria are known for." He shuffles his papers before continuing. "The first clinical trials were performed by Soteria Director Nakharan Mkne himself on the surface floors and the resounding success has now led the Soteria to offer psionic ascension to any and all capable of obtaining it."

<i>Nowak pauses, checking his papers. </i>"It would appear that those with cybernetic implants, such as death alarms, cruciforms, or organ modules like arm blades, cannot become psions, as the body must have perceived 'purity' according to high ranking Chief Research Overseer Jeanne Petite. As to why this is the case, they are uncertain, but the knowledge has certainly earned the ire of the church, who have been left grumbling about the recent development even while the faction maintains a neutral stance on psions."

<i>Nowak leans back on his chair, tapping his desk with his hand before he speaks off script to the camera. </i>"While some ponder what may become of these psions and what potential unknown dangers they present, is yet to be seen. Spokesman from the confederacy, our void wolf allies, and various frontier factions also have voiced concern with this development. More so when the Soteria have refused to share it with anyone outside the colony. What our allies will do, is yet to be seen. I for one think if they want to benefit from the colonies discoveries, they should pay two arms, two legs, and a few kidneys. But, for now, this is communications officer Nowak, signing off."
