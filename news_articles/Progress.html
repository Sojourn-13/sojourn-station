Soteria is pleased to announce that research has hit a new milestone through the use of their greyson AI Brynn and recovered artifice from the hivemind. While questionable, given the associated risks, hive lord bioprocessors were recovered by Soteria personnel and experimented upon. Though a few were destroyed during testing, use of methods provided by Soteria's captured greyson intelligence provided additional avenues of study which yielded quite extraordinary results. Theories proposed by Soteria researchers that hiveminds worked as "repositories" of information for the hivemind consciousness have now been proven correct, as once a safe and established method to retrieve information was developed the Soteria was inundated with millions of yottabytes of data. The absolute breadth of data has proven a challenge to decode and a large bulk of it proved either useless or trivial, but snippets of metaphysical gold have already been discovered.

So far, these discoveries have largely been towards quantum computing, the methods in which Soteria runs most of its AI and research systems. With it, they have improved a large portion of their research network and applied it to existing data stores and servers. This functionality, while largely unnoticed by the bulk of Soteria, will be quite the boon towards the research and development area.

In addition, rumors are abound that a large portion of data recovered from these hivemind bioprocessors detail information gathered during the hiveminds singular sojourn into deep maintenance. Compounded with this is other rumors detailing that the strange and esoteric nature of the place known as deep maintenance is starting to leak out onto various places, with many believing that we may see strange and unusual changes in the following weeks. Whether these rumors are true or not is currently unconfirmed, but the Soteria director, who at this time has made no comment on the matter, has been confirmed to be dispatching teams to investigate the potential outcomes based on recovered data.

What becomes of the rest of this yet to be plumbed data is yet to be known, but as always, the march for progress continues.
