Late into a shift on the 25th the colony went to delta alert, under the threat of mass geological and biological movement. Alarms raised and the council was quickly called to action. The whole colony scrambled to arms to defend its home once more.

Like moths to a flame, the entirety of all local spiders began a march, on the surface, through maint and under the tiles of the halls, all moving to Soteria. Floors bursting with swarms of grown and growing spiderings spewed forth into the colony. Just the first wave involved empresses, emperors, and a reported reaper. With dozens upon dozens of every kind of spider known flooding the halls. The chitinous army made its way to the doors of the genetics lab, fighting foot by foot with the colony. As the first mere digging wave broke upon the effort of all involved, the cause of their rage was discovered, and terminated before the following wave of leviathans crashed upon the colonies gates.

Soteria, in its efforts to bring back a headless colonist, transplanted them into a monkey, followed by a spider empress via a "mind transplant" device. All done with paperwork and legality, Soteria claims only good intentions as they sought a more comfortable body for the colonist. Soteria theorizes on the causes for the spider assault, if they sought to remove this oddity from their hive, or if they desired to embrace it, or if the sentience drove them all to temporary madness. For now there is nothing concrete.

The amount of spiders that rushed the colony was enough to start seismic alerts, they are numerous, and in only small cases have shown such intelligence and anger towards the colony. As such, the council is moving forward with new research laws. Namely outlawing the research of human minds transplanted into hive sentience creatures. So far rumors state spiders and xenomorphs are to be banned from mind research without Mknes' approval. Hopefully the bounds wont be pushed again this way.<br>
