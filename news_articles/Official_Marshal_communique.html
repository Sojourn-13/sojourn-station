It has come to the attention of the office of the Provost Marshal, as well as the High Council-at-large, that previously handled issues are being brought up to the detriment of the colony. Arin Moon has been investigated multiple times for different offenses and, in light of an absence of necessary evidence, no formal charges can or will be addressed. There will be no more requests or attempts to address matters previous to this point. It is the decision of this High Council that an injunction be placed on Risikio Iscariot and Arin Moon. They are to have no contact with one another, save for exigent circumstances or legitimate matters of colony business. They are expressly forbidden to address previous grievances or matters that have been determined to be resolved.
<br>
<br>
Failure to uphold this injunction, especially on part of Risikio Iscariot, will result in review for immediate termination of contract with no ability nor recourse for appeal. This matter is finished and shall not be re-addressed. For the purpose of this injunction “legitimate matters of colony business” shall refer to job related functions that are otherwise necessary and do not continue longer than is absolutely necessary.
