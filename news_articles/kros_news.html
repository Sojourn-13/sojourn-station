Yesterday, the Imperial Palace of Krios stated their intent to create another anti-blockade platform in Krio’s orbit. This would be the third such platform and would represent the final construct necessary for the planetary defensive network to be considered ‘’Operational”. While many are hailing this as the final nail in the coffin for Sol’s fleet, a quiet but steadily growing movement has begun to openly call for a more offensive posture from the Imperial Government. This yet unnamed collective has been circulating in various locations and social circles but has apparently found it’s way into the Imperial court with some Castellian’s throwing their statements into the mix. Time will tell if the government will remain iron clad in their defense strategy or if we’ll soon be taking to the stars to bring the fight to Sol themselves.

In other news; a high-priority alert has gone out after a rogue ship launched from sector A-14 and managed to evade local authorities. It’s currently unknown why the sky was ablaze with gunfire in an effort to stop the craft but one of its engines was allegedly blown in high-orbit. The office of the defense fleet has stated they’re mobilizing in reference to this brazen affront to the Air Traffic Control’s authority though declined to give a further statement.
