<br>
Date: March 3st, 2651
<br>
Report Type: Interrogation of excelsior traitor, destruction of a listening post
<br>
Interrogators: Darius Va' Ra-da, Jeanne Petite
<br>
<br>
Key Information
<br>
* A listening post had been in operation outside the colony for nearly three weeks, a detailed log was being kept by a lone agent.
<br>
* The agent, named Rags, was not meant to be captured alive, having an implanted 'brain fryer' that would make it his final death if he was recovered by burning his brain to ashes if his heart stopped. He, however, was captured alive.
<br>
* The captured agent revealed the excelsior had a "jack knife" calss shuttle, one designed to go planet-side and into space, outfitted for speed and a large cargo hold for materials or personnel movement.
<br>
* The information detailed in his log book has been determined as artificed subterfuge meant to misdirect the colony, as the detection of bluespace and the nature of such easily access data led investigators to believe the information was not genuine.

Details
<br>
At around 04:00 hours during a routine surface shift a bluespace anomaly was detected, with entropic decay in a localized area exceeding safe levels. As a result, an investigatory expedition was sent out to discovery the source. After much initial searching, an excelsior operational facility was discovered under ground, protected by automated turrets and a lone operative. After a brief skirmish, the machines were dismantled and the agent captured alive. After being taken back to the colony, the agent was then interrogated, but information provided was not forthcoming, and while many details did match and support existing ones known by the colony, it was ultimately determined to be unreliable as the keeping of a written log book, without cypher, proved too good to be taken as real. As a result, little of what the operative said could be substantiated and unlike previous captures, was vehemently pro-excelsior. Of special mention was the idea that the excelsior has been seeking the hire of high profile mercenaries to act on their behalf, agents that either cannot or will not allow themselves to be subverted and are too dangerous to try. The note did mention that Xiang Jiang agents would not work with excelsior, which is supportive of prior information gathered about said group. However, investigators were lead to believe that a former xiang jiang, if any of the evidence on the documents were true, might attack the colony the following day. Further details are not being released as of now, until it can be confirmed the validity of them.<br>
