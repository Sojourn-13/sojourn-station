Late last night an unmarked FBP came to the colony with advanced tech. Hacking into the colony's systems and making its presence known as Morning Star. It offered all colonists on shift one wish to be fulfilled of any request it could achieve from handing out cups of water to assassinations. The suit it used for this was reported to be extremely advanced, with electronic warfare, self charging, cloak, and a module believed to be a rig mounted bluespace harpoon. Exactly what it had will never be known as the suit was destroyed via ion weapons during the FBPs capture. Many received their gifts before this though with some claiming to have received things as simple as cups of hot chocolate, to half a million credits. The legitimacy of these gifts has yet to be determined. Apparently at two times the FBP was "Wished" to simply come talk, one of which times was used against it to destroy it. The surface team did not reboot it and sent it down in a dysfunctional state.

Upon re-activation at the lower colony, Morning Star requested the time and location. The information was granted at which point it made a statement that "Those that wished to speak with me used it to kill me, and did not want me back... I do not want to be back either." At which point reports say the FBP became unresponsive and simply requested a pistol in the 50 kurts range with one bullet. This report was repeated against all lines of questioning. After 3 hours the interrogation was called off, and by decision of the council the FBP was passed off to soteria where its current state is unknown.

Many are not sure what to think of this event, or its apparent benefactors. People say they use these FBPs for entertainment. For now we will simply go on as we have, this is only the first interaction with this apparent entity. If there really even is such an entity. The upper council nor lower council was able to find evidence of anything concrete, so for now we wait and continue as we have.<br>
