Soteria is once again in hot water for the actions of a presently unnamed research overseer who elected to retrieve and study the psionic monsters of deep maints through the use of soteria AI and cyborgs. This prospective bot managed to collect and secure several specimens on its own and bring them to xenobotany for study.

However, unknown to anyone at the time, this caused what is now being called a psionic resonance cascade that called the dreaming king and his murderous hound to Xenobiology. Several scientist noted screaming, flickering and blown out lights, and the appearance of unexplained gore on the floors before the resident AI alerted to a potential outbreak. Colony response was swift, but the reaction of these monsters proved as deadly.

To make matters worse, shortly after a scientist and colonist attempted to 'clone' a higher life form, that being one of the diseased colonist. As many readers will know, the cloning of an intelligent life form is not possible for even the Soteria. This attempt resulted in 5 additional casualties, as the attempted genetic mutation of a monkey with colonist DNA caused an immediate mutation that went on to mutate and effectively kill three more people.

While horrific and a prime example of why the Marshals retain the power to halt experiments done by the Soteria for colony safety, the event has been ruled as accidental, with the punishment of actors within Soteria being handled in house. However, Soteria has been levied a hefty fine and cited for this gross incompetency. Another foot note in their already decaying reputation.<br>
