===Psionic Medicine: Are empaths the perfect psychologists? (powered by Nadezhda Newscenter®™)===

A lonestar news logo appears on the holoscreen before fading into communications officer Nowak, sitting at a desk with a few sheaths of paper, here to report news within the colony.

<i>Nowak shuffles his paper, looking at them for a moment before turning his gaze towards the camera. </i>"Good evening, as some of you among the Soteria may have heard, the progress into psionic research as finally hit its first mile stone. Soteria Medical is now offering its first and newest form of psychiatric and psychological aid to the colony, in addition to new psionic thought experimentation." <i>Nowak frowns slightly as he speaks, clearly finding the idea less than welcome, though he continues on. </i>"Soteria Psychiatrist who have 'mastered the mind' as I'm reading." <i>Nowak favors the camera with a sarcastic look.</i> "Have found they have developed additional psionic powers allowing them to aid their fellow colonists. These powers, supposedly, settle the mind and enhance the body through psychosomatic therapy. How that works on a technical level I have no fucking..."

<i> Nowak pauses. </i> "I have no idea if I'm allowed to swear, well that gives my manager something to think about. Anyways, I have no fucking clue what that means on a technical level, so further details need to be found with the Soteria." <i> He shuffles his papers before leaning back on his chair, going a bit off script given his sudden eased tone and small smirk at the corners of his lips. </i> "So now the psychs can reach directly into your head and fix problems, I see no problem with that. It makes me wonder just whats going to happen when Soteria hits its next milestone, but hey, that's what makes living here so interesting, am I right?"<i>  He chuckles as the Lonestar news logo appears and the screen fades to black.</i>
